## About Biovega Services

We are committed to providing **self-service access** to key data and functionality, reducing manual communication and improving transparency.

Our platform is designed to:

- **Expose Digital Services**  
  Provide consistent, real-time access to product data, pricing, availability, and other relevant information.

- **Enable Automation**  
  Allow partners and customers to integrate directly with Biovega systems, automating common workflows and reducing manual effort.

- **Scale for the Future**  
  Build a robust foundation that will support additional digital services as our offering grows.

## Initial Release: REST API & OData Endpoints

Our first milestone is the launch of **REST** and **OData** endpoints, allowing customers and partners to:

- Retrieve up-to-date information about Biovega products  
- Integrate product data directly into their systems  
- Build their own applications and workflows on top of Biovega data  

➡ **Explore the API:** [Swagger Documentation (Coming Soon)]({{ site.baseurl }}/swagger)

This is just the beginning — our roadmap includes expanding to additional services and domains to cover more of our customers' and partners' needs.
